  I've been SA'd and Groomed multiple times as a kid, that fucked up my mind badly and ive started saying , talking about and feeling alot of sexual things, later finding out im VERY hypersexual, sighs being hypersexual isnt fun, it changes the way you see things, for example a hypersexual person (idk if its for everyone but i suffer from it)  would think of something like 'being groomed' awesome n fun because it involves sexual things, grooming is never fun and I wont make my hypersexuality make fucked up things seem okay. 
  I just felt like mentioning this so if I ever started making alot of inappropriate jokes around anyone of my friends and you find it weird, its just who i am now, i just have to learn to control what i say and know when to stop. Dont be afraid to let me know if I ever made you uncomfortable!

  wip again..
